        <p>One day, Mum, you’ll rest.<br />
        You’ll breathe knowing your children stood tall — because of you.<br />
        You’ll sit back with your tea,<br />
        And smile at all the seeds you planted in faith.</p>

        <p>You gave us roots. Now we give you wings.<br />
        We’re building our lives — brick by brick,<br />
        But your fingerprints are on every brick we lay.</p>

        <p>You are the beginning of every good thing in us.<br />
        This is your garden, Mama.<br />
        And we — your sons and daughters — are blooming.</p>

        <p><strong>We are because you are.</strong><br />
        And this is just the beginning.</p>

        <footer>With everything we are,<br />
        <strong>— Your son, Mikey</strong></footer>
